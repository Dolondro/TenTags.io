Crossposts
- submit to each tag
- comments either per tag or all together, allow filtering
- Each submission has a submissionID + node
- linking posts as duplicate links to same node
- same comment sper node
- different votes per submission, not node
- linking posts needs to eithe be a threshold by users or done by mods

Reposts
- Allow linking to other submissions
- Link types, duplicate or related
- If a person has already seen that node, dont show it again
- Optionally hide the posts theyve already seen after they lcick on them or are served them


Vote Weighting
- wieght votes depending on wether the person is subscribed, wehter they viewed the link, etc



Other Ideas from reddit
- Option to turn of PM's
- Add optional link to credit/original source
- Rank posts based on discussion (number of comments, length of comments etc)
- other tags like NSFL, spoiler, etc
- Vote out mods
- Instead of deleted, mark as 'deleted by <name>'
- show related sub based on common user base
- Limit number of subs a mod can moderate
- sub specific report reasons
- sticky comments in a post
- allow changing title within time duration
