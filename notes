Crossposts
- submit to each tag
- comments either per tag or all together, allow filtering
- Each submission has a submissionID + node
- linking posts as duplicate links to same node
- same comments per post/xpost
- different votes per submission, not node
- linking posts needs to eithe be a threshold by users or done by mods

Reposts
- Allow linking to other submissions
- Link types, duplicate or related
- If a person has already seen that node, dont show it again
- Optionally hide the posts theyve already seen after they lcick on them or are served them


Vote Weighting
- weight votes depending on wether the person is subscribed, wehter they viewed the link, etc



Other Ideas from reddit
- Option to turn of PM's
- Add optional link to credit/original source
- Rank posts based on discussion (number of comments, length of comments etc)
- other tags like NSFL, spoiler, etc
- Vote out mods
- Instead of deleted, mark as 'deleted by <name>'
- show related sub based on common user base
- Limit number of subs a mod can moderate
- sub specific report reasons
- sticky comments in a post
- allow changing title within time duration


Nodes
 reposts are going to have different titles anyway, so that needs to be supported, and leads to the idea of enable crossposts directly from that post
 posts have a node, the node gets changed to the node of the original post,
 post has the title, then the text, then the list of reposts(expandable)
 split comments into tabs  (current/previous/all etc) and default to just submissions for the current post.

Keeping it simple:
 - Show the title of the post, the address of the link, and the tags on the main page
 - Show the title, the History, and the comments on the post page
 - 'Add Tag' - auto crosspost with same title to another sub, otherwise have option to change title etc.

Front page views
 Minimal, hacker-news style
 - Just title, domain, and tags
 Pantopikos style
 - Expand all pictures into neverending grid


Prevent crosspost spam
- people may try to crosspost to as many subs as possible to maximise karma
- allow maximum x number of tags
- allow banning/post approval

Related posts
need a link type for media, e.g. gifs, videos, article related to a common subject.


Frontpage workflow
 select posts where tagID in userLikedTags
 and tagID not in userDislikeTags
 and nodeID not in userSeenNodes
 and tagCreationTime > (currentTime - X)
 orderBy score (where score is time score + postScore, possible with user weighting)

 insert into userSeenTags
  (new shownTagID)

Incentive - sweet sweet karma
incentive for crossposts = karma from that crosspost
incentive for linking to original post??
incentive not to link posts that arent related?

Alternative for hiding clicked posts rather than seen:
 - prepend all text links with a passthrough url like /passthrough/<userID>/<postID>

Edge cases
 - user sees a post, its node gets added to seenNodes
 - post gets linked to original post, its node changes to original posts
 - user will end up seeing the post again.

nodes
  selecting:
    select posts where tags in usertags and node id not in userseen
  updating:
    update post set nodeid = newnodeid
    insert newnode into seennodes where oldnode in seennodes
    delete oldnode from users where oldnode in seennodes


new idea
post has parentID
post has postlinks table:
 - postID
 - postparentid
 - up
 - down

top voted postlink becomes post parent id

retrieve posts with:
  select post where postid not in seenposts
  and parentpostid not in seenposts
