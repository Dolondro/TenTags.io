caching

data stored long term in redis
cache pulls from redis, stores in shared dict (ram but no limits)
per-worker LRU stores most frequently accessed in memory (max 4GB)

cache invalidation
 - background workers mark cache objects as SetKeepalive
 - cache invalidator periodically purges caceh of stale objects
 - should means that someone that gets updated multiple times by a worker will only be purged once,

bloom filters
 - per user bloom filter of seen posts
 - efficient
 - check both the postID and post parentID to check if user has seen
 - users dont see reposts! (or not many do)
